# Example development env. Leave empty to use Vite proxy (default).
# To target your backend on the local network, set the API base to your machine's LAN IP.
# Example (replace 192.168.1.50 with your backend's IP):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.8:80

# If you want Vite dev server to proxy /api to that host instead of localhost,
# set VITE_API_BASE_URL before running `npm run dev`.
